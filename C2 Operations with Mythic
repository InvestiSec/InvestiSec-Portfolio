# C2 Operations with Mythic  

## Objective  
Deploy and operate a modern command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to understand attacker workflows and test blue-team detection strategies.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Mythic C2  
- Redirector server (Nginx)  
- Cloud provider (Linode)  
- Custom phishing domains with HTTPS  

## Setup & Process  
- Deployed Mythic using Docker on a cloud server.  
- Configured redirector traffic proxy with Nginx.  
- Registered domains and applied TLS with Letâ€™s Encrypt.  
- Hosted payloads and simulated phishing campaigns.  

## Simulations / Use Cases  
- Payload creation and delivery through redirector.  
- Tasking compromised endpoints from Mythic.  
- Observed C2 traffic for detection opportunities.  

## Outcomes  
- Practical experience with C2 frameworks.  
- Learned OPSEC techniques (redirectors, domain setup).  
- Gained insight into network-based C2 detection.  

## Screenshots / Evidence  
*(Include payload logs, redirector config snippets, or Mythic console screenshots.)*
