# Adversary Simulation with Atomic Red Team  

## Objective  
Simulate adversary behavior in a controlled environment to validate SIEM detections and understand attack visibility.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Atomic Red Team  
- Sysmon  
- Wazuh SIEM  
- MITRE ATT&CK framework  

## Setup & Process  
- Installed Atomic Red Team and executed specific ATT&CK techniques.  
- Monitored activity with Sysmon logs and forwarded them to Wazuh.  
- Correlated results with detection rules and ATT&CK mappings.  

## Simulations / Use Cases  
- Credential dumping from LSASS.  
- Process injection.  
- Discovery and lateral movement activity.  

## Outcomes  
- Validated SIEM rules against multiple ATT&CK techniques.  
- Identified visibility gaps and refined detection rules.  
- Strengthened understanding of attacker TTPs.
