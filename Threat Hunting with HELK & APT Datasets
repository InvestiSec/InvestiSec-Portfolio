# Threat Hunting with HELK & APT Datasets  

## Objective  
Use HELK to ingest and analyze threat datasets, hunting for artifacts of real-world APT campaigns.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- HELK (Hunting ELK)  
- APT datasets (e.g., APT29)  
- MITRE ATT&CK framework  

## Setup & Process  
- Installed HELK on lab infrastructure.  
- Ingested open-source datasets simulating APT activity.  
- Built detection queries in Kibana.  

## Simulations / Use Cases  
- Investigated persistence, credential access, and lateral movement techniques.  
- Mapped findings to MITRE ATT&CK.  

## Outcomes  
- Improved threat hunting skills by analyzing realistic APT data.  
- Practiced building queries and dashboards for detection engineering.  
- Connected attacker artifacts to forensic timelines.
