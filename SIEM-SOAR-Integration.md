# SIEM & SOAR Integration Lab  

## Objective  
Build a full-stack security monitoring and response platform to detect adversary activity and automate incident workflows.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Wazuh SIEM  
- TheHive & Cortex  
- MISP (Threat Intelligence)  
- Shuffle SOAR  
- Sysmon, Suricata, Velociraptor  

## Setup & Process  
- Deployed Wazuh Manager and integrated Sysmon and Suricata agents.  
- Configured Velociraptor for DFIR and endpoint telemetry.  
- Connected alerts to TheHive for case management.  
- Automated enrichment with Cortex and MISP.  

## Simulations / Use Cases  
- Executed Atomic Red Team TTPs (e.g., LSASS dumping, lateral movement).  
- Mapped detections to MITRE ATT&CK tactics.  
- Triggered automated workflows for incident triage and enrichment.  

## Outcomes  
- Unified log ingestion from multiple sources.  
- Automated enrichment reduced manual investigation effort.  
- Improved detection coverage for common attack techniques.
