# SIEM & SOAR Integration Lab

## Objective  
Build a security monitoring platform that integrates SIEM, SOAR, and threat intelligence to detect and respond to adversary techniques.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Wazuh SIEM  
- TheHive & Cortex  
- MISP (threat intelligence)  
- Shuffle SOAR  
- Sysmon, Suricata, Velociraptor  

## Setup & Process  
1. Describe the environment you built (VMs, cloud, tools connected).  
2. Mention the key steps (integration, configuration, log ingestion, alerting).  
3. Keep it high-level, not a full tutorial.  

*Example: Installed Wazuh Manager, configured Sysmon agents, integrated Suricata IDS, connected alerts to TheHive, automated enrichment with Cortex, and playbooks with Shuffle.*  

## Simulations / Use Cases  
- Simulated attacks with **Atomic Red Team** (e.g., LSASS dumping, lateral movement).  
- Mapped detections to **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques.  
- Validated SIEM and SOAR rules.  

## Outcomes  
- Enabled correlation of 5+ log sources for comprehensive incident visibility.  
- Automated enrichment and response actions through SOAR integration.  
- Improved detection coverage across multiple ATT&CK tactics.  

## Screenshots / Evidence  
*(Add 2–3 images or diagrams: dashboards, alerts, detection hits, etc.)*

# Example: C2 Operations with Mythic  

## Objective  
Deploy a command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to understand attacker workflows and test defensive visibility.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Mythic C2  
- Cloud server (e.g., Linode, DigitalOcean)  
- Redirector server  
- Registered domains with HTTPS  

## Setup & Process  
- Deployed Mythic C2 server with Docker.  
- Configured a redirector with Nginx.  
- Registered and secured custom domains with Let’s Encrypt.  

## Simulations / Use Cases  
- Hosted phishing domains.  
- Delivered payloads via redirector.  
- Observed C2 traffic and tested detection with Suricata/Wazuh.  

## Outcomes  
- Learned C2 operator workflows (payload creation, listener setup, tasking).  
- Gained insight into network-based detection opportunities.
