## Featured Labs & Write-Ups

| Project | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| **SIEM & SOAR Integration Lab** | Built a full-stack incident response system with Wazuh, TheHive, Cortex, MISP, Shuffle, and DFIR tools. [Explore details – SIEM & SOAR Integration Lab](./SIEM%20%26%20SOAR%20Integration%20Lab/README.md)
| **Adversary Simulation** | Emulated attacker techniques through Atomic Red Team, validated detections and resilient monitoring. [Explore details – Adversary Simulation with Atomic Red Team](./Adversary%20Simulation%20with%20Atomic%20Red%20Team/README.md)
| **C2 Operations with Mythic** | Deployed Mythic C2 infrastructure, built redirector, simulated phishing and payload delivery. [Explore details – C2 Operations with Mythic](./C2%20Operations%20with%20Mythic/README.md)
| **Threat Hunting with HELK & APT Datasets** | Ingested APT datasets into HELK to drive detection logic and uncover known attacker artifacts. [Explore details – Threat Hunting with HELK & APT Datasets](./Threat%20Hunting%20with%20HELK%20%26%20APT%20Datasets/README.md)
