## Featured Labs & Write-Ups

| Project | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| **SIEM & SOAR Integration Lab** | Built a full-stack incident response system with Wazuh, TheHive, Cortex, MISP, Shuffle, and DFIR tools. [Explore details](./SIEM%20%26%20SOAR%20Integration%20Lab/README.md) |
| **Adversary Simulation** | Emulated attacker techniques through Atomic Red Team, validated detections and resilient monitoring. [Explore details](./Adversary%20Simulation/README.md) |
| **C2 Operations with Mythic** | Deployed Mythic C2 infrastructure, built redirector, simulated phishing and payload delivery. [Explore details](./C2%20Operations%20with%20Mythic/README.md) |
| **Threat Hunting with HELK & APT Datasets** | Ingested APT datasets into HELK to drive detection logic and uncover known attacker artifacts. [Explore details](./Threat%20Hunting%20with%20HELK%20%26%20APT%20Datasets/README.md) |
| **Suricata IDS Integration with Wazuh** | Installed and configured Suricata on Ubuntu, enabled Emerging Threats rules, and forwarded alerts to Wazuh Manager for correlation and visibility. [Explore details](./Suricata-IDS-Wazuh-Integration.md)
